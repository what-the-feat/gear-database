# gear-database

This is a (POC) for a community-based gear database. 

I personnaly want to start with musical gear (synths, midi keyboards, ...) but it can be easily evolve on other domains.
This repository is just a bunch of JSON data.


## Todo 

- Json schema for each entities : brand, feature and product + community rules for values
- More informations on product and brand : images, urls, ...
